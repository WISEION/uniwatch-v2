# OPEN-QUESTIONS — deviation and assumption log

Every deviation from PRD v1.0 / master development plan (2026-07-28), and every new assumption made during implementation, is recorded here at the time it is made — never decided silently (kickoff TZ, "Порядок работы" item 3; `AGENTS.md` §4).

Format per entry:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title

**Context:** what task/phase surfaced this.
**Deviation/assumption:** what was decided and why the source docs did not already cover it.
**Source conflict (if any):** which documents disagree, and which one won per the priority order (PRD > master plan > source map / v1 audit).
**Owner follow-up needed:** yes/no — if yes, link to the relevant `D-*`/`TBD-*` in `docs/CONTEXT.md`.
```

The blocking-but-not-now owner questions (`D-HOST`, `D-IDP`, `D-SRC`, `D-LANG`) and the never-defaulted `TBD-01..05` are tracked in `docs/CONTEXT.md`, not duplicated here — this file is for deviations discovered during build, not the pre-known open list from planning.

## 2026-08-04 — CI runner platform

**Context:** Task 0.D (qa), wiring the Fast/Full CI gates (`docs/reports/PLAN-MISSION-1.md` §2).

**Deviation/assumption:** Neither the PRD nor the master development plan names a CI vendor/platform anywhere in their gate model (Gate 0-5, master plan §22) — they describe what each gate checks, not what runs it. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (GitHub Actions) was added as the concrete runner. This is a low-risk implementation choice (a common default, easy to replace, no lock-in to any hosting decision), not a re-interpretation of a locked requirement.

**Source conflict (if any):** None — the source docs are simply silent on CI vendor. Not a PRD-vs-master-plan disagreement.

**Owner follow-up needed:** No. Distinct from `D-HOST` (production hosting: local network/private cloud/public cloud) — a CI runner choice does not imply or constrain that decision. If a different CI platform is later preferred, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the only file that needs to change; the gate *contents* (`.ci/README.md`) are platform-agnostic.

## 2026-08-04 — eTender event-details capture shows VÖEN and monetary value (contradicts locked "0/103" fact) — RESOLVED same day

**Context:** Task 1.A (`docs/reports/PLAN-MISSION-1.md` §3), live capture of frozen fixtures for the
empirical-contract connector (see `fixtures/tender-snapshots/etender/MANIFEST.md`).

**Deviation/assumption:** A real, bounded `GET https://etender.gov.az/api/events/355920` (2026-08-04)
returned `"organizationVoen": "1000418451"` and `"estimatedAmount": 16922253.74` populated. This appeared
to contradict the locked fact in `uniwatch-v2-project.md`/`docs/CONTEXT.md`: "eTender feed carries no
VÖEN (0/103 events) and no monetary values (0/103)".

**Resolution (same-day follow-up, browser network trace + `GET /api/events` capture):** Confirmed, not
just theorized — the **events list** resource (`events_list_page1.raw.json`) has neither a buyer-VÖEN
field nor any monetary field on its items (`eventId`, `eventType`, `eventStatus`,
`buyerOrganizationName`, `eventName`, `publishDate`, `endDate`, `hasNewVersion`,
`awardedParticipantName`, `awardedParticipantVoen`, `documentViewType`, `actualVersionId`,
`privateRfxId`, `hasRecreated` — `awardedParticipantVoen` is the *winning bidder's* VÖEN, populated only
after award, not the buyer's). The "0/103" fact is correct for the list resource. VÖEN/`estimatedAmount`
are **details-subresource-only** fields — exactly the `FR-TND-07` independent-subresource-status case,
not a contradiction. No old fact was wrong; two different subresources simply carry different fields.

**Source conflict (if any):** None — resolved without needing to override either source.

**Owner follow-up needed:** No further action. Phase 4 (`value_basis`/buyer-identity handling) can rely on:
list resource has no VÖEN/money, details resource has both, when present.

## 2026-08-04 — eTender events-list endpoint contract not captured this session — RESOLVED same day

**Context:** Same task 1.A fixture-capture session as above.

**Deviation/assumption:** `GET https://etender.gov.az/api/events` returned `400 Bad Request`
(RFC 9110 problem+json, no field-level validation detail) for every query-parameter combination tried in
that bounded session (`PageSize`/`PageNumber`, `pageSize`/`pageNumber`, `Skip`/`Take`, `PageIndex`,
with/without `EventType`, with/without a publish-date range); `POST /api/events` returned
`405 Method Not Allowed`. Task 1.A proceeded on the **details** and **BOQ** resources only — sufficient
for that task. List-resource resumable pagination is task **1.B** scope, not 1.A.

**Resolution (same-day follow-up, live browser network trace of the real search page via
`claude-in-chrome`, not further guessing):** The real frontend request is
`GET /api/events?EventType=&PageSize=6&PageNumber=1&EventStatus=1&Keyword=&buyerOrganizationName=&documentNumber=&publishDateFrom=&publishDateTo=&AwardedparticipantName=&AwardedparticipantVoen=&DocumentViewType=&IsArchived=false`
— every listed key must be present in the query string (even empty string), with `PageSize`,
`PageNumber`, `EventStatus` (int), `IsArchived` (bool) non-empty. No cookie or CSRF token required — a
bare `curl` with this exact key set returns `200` (`events_list_page1.raw.json`, checksummed in
`MANIFEST.md`). The earlier `400`s were from ASP.NET query-DTO model binding failing whole-object when a
required non-nullable property (`EventStatus`/`IsArchived`) had no query key at all — not present-but-
wrong-typed, just entirely absent — with no field-level detail surfaced in the error body. `EventType`
itself can be empty (unfiltered) or a specific code; the connector must still validate the actual
`eventType` returned per item rather than trust the requested filter (`FR-TND-10`, unchanged).

**Source conflict (if any):** None.

**Owner follow-up needed:** No further action needed to start 1.B — the query contract above is ready to
use. 1.B itself (resumable pagination implementation) has not started; this only removes its blocker.
